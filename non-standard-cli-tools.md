### um
[um](https://github.com/sinclairtarget/um) is a command line utility for
maintaining your personal set of `man` like help pages.

Use `um edit <keyword>` to edit a page, and `um <keyword>` to read your
manpage.  For example, if you have a number of uses for `grep` that are used
regularly, but too complicated to remember, you can simply
~~~
um edit grep
~~~
and make a `man` page just for your use.
